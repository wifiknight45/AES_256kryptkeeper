## AES_256kryptkeeper
## overview
implements AES-256 encryption and decryption for files or messages using the pycryptodome library, featuring secure key derivation, random salt and IV generation, error handling, and a command-line interface for user interaction.

## a Python script that implements AES-256 encryption and decryption using the pycryptodome library. The script includes enhancements for security, robustness, versatility, and scalability.

Enhancements:
Key Derivation: Uses PBKDF2 to derive a secure key from a password.
Salt Generation: Generates a random salt for key derivation to enhance security.
Initialization Vector (IV): Uses a random IV for each encryption to ensure uniqueness.
File Handling: Supports both file and message encryption/decryption.
Error Handling: Includes error handling for robustness.
Base64 Encoding: Encodes the encrypted data in Base64 for safe storage and transmission.
Secure Password Input: Uses getpass for secure password input.
Output Formatting: Provides clear output messages for user interaction.
Command-Line Interface: Implements a simple CLI for ease of use.
Scalability: Modular functions for encryption and decryption to allow for easy integration into larger applications.
